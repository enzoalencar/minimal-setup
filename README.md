## Description

The goal of minimal-setup was to explore **Minimal API** concepts using [**FastEndpoints**](https://fast-endpoints.com/) and practice base programming concepsts:

- Main Archtecture
    - [Vertical Slice](https://www.jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/)

- Design Patterns
    - REPR
    - CQRS
    - Dependency Injection
    - Repository Pattern

- Initial JWT Auth
- Swagger; Entity Framework
- PostgreSQL

It didn’t turn out exactly as I had imagined, but it was my first time working with some of these tools/patterns.  
I liked the end result, but there’s definitely room for improvement.
